        that sees the world as a constant harmony of collaborations, formed to create breath-taking masterpieces. Taught
        by master conductors, they are taught the importance of being apart of something much bigger than themselves
        with this lesson:
        “A solo is normally hailed as the most memorable part of a symphony but remove the symphony then on its own,
        there is no spark. The world is built upon collaborations and it is when a collection of individuals are brought
        under the same umbrella that true beauty is unleashed. Listen, students, music flows through everyone of us,
        pick up your batons and guide it!”
        These bards are able to tap directly into the musical flow around us and manipulate it to begin a performance
        that leaves no one behind.</i></p>
