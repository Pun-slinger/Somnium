Many who bear this power can trace their magic back to an ancestor making a deal with a denizen of the Hells of Movys or who might even claimed one as a parent. Most considered the origin of the power to be cursed and will do anything to get rid of it while others view this as an opportunity to reach higher heights. However you came to view it, this magic flows within you and whether you like it or not, with it comes the connection to Movys and their twisted game, waiting for a new player to join the board.</i></p>
