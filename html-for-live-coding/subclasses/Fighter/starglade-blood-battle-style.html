        <p id="subclass-overview-text" class="text-left mx-5 mb-5 p-2 rounded">
            <i>Created by the “Blood Battle God”, Kain Arwin Starglade. It was said that Starglade developed the style
                as a response to hunt vampires more effectively thanks to his innate talent for hemocraft. His initial
                goal with the style is for the eradication of all vampires but soon after, modifications was made to the
                style to be more well-rounded for general combat.</i>
            <br>
            <i>To learn the Starglade Blood Battle Style is perhaps one of the hardest processed one can partake in.
                Starglade takes in extremely few apprentices with even fewer succeeding in mastering the style. The
                journey will be beyond difficult, but you will come out a terror in the eyes of evil threatening the
                innocents.</i>
            <br>
            <i>To become a wielder of the Starglade Blood Battle Style is to be something most will fear. Your use of
                hemocraft will be questioned, despite for the greater good. But, what you carry in your hands and your
                body is too important to be swayed by any trivial discussions. Become a monster to fight back monsters
                and protect the innocents. Once fueled by vengeance, now fueled by justice, carry the Starglade legacy
                and honor it, not with the amount you have slayed but those you have saved.</i>

        <h1 id="ability-title" class="text-left ml-5">Blood Manipulation</h1>
        <p id="ability-text" class="text-left mx-5 mb-2">Upon selecting this subclass at 3rd level, you gain the ability
            to manipulate your blood by channeling magic through it and use it to perform blood techniques. You gain
            access to the following basic blood techniques</p>

        <ul class="text-left mx-5 mb-4">
            <li>
                <p id="ability-text"><b>Cradle Weaver</b>: as an action, you create strands of blood emitting from your
                    fingertips and weave a net made of blood that covers a 10ft radius area in a space up to 10 ft from
                    you. The net can be used to hold up to 30 pounds of items or wrapped over an item to keep its shape
                    together, similar to glue.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p id="ability-text"><b>Extended Limb</b>: as an action, you form your blood into a hand which then can
                    extend up to 60 ft from you. You can use your action to control the hand to manipulate an object,
                    open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the
                    contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p id="ability-text"><b>Seeking Tether</b>: as an action, you can make contact with a creature and
                    attach your blood to it. The blood then extends into a thin line, tracking the creature’s movement
                    and location. This line can extend for as long as you still have blood in your body but you lose 1
                    hit point every round while using this technique.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="ability-title" class="text-left ml-5">Hemorrhage Trigger</h1>
        <p id="ability-text" class="text-left mx-5 mb-4">You gain access to a Hemorrhage Trigger dice, which is a d4,
            upon selecting this subclass at 3rd level. In order to use any blood techniques that are not the basic ones,
            you lose an amount of hit points equal to a roll of your Hemorrhage Trigger dice.</p>


        <h1 id="ability-title" class="text-left ml-5">Starglade Blood Battle Techniques</h1>
        <p id="ability-text" class="text-left mx-5 mb-4">When you select this subclass at 3rd level, you get the choice
            between the Cero branch and the Ardere branch of the Starglade Blood Battle Style to learn and master. Once
            a branch is chosen, the user will get access to the techniques developed for that specific branch and this
            choice can not be changed once selected. Some of the techniques require your target to make a saving throw
            to resist the technique’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Blood techniques save DC =
            8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</p>

        <p id="ability-text" class="text-left mx-5 mb-3"><b>Cero branch</b>: this branch allows the user to manipulate
            their blood into blades or threads as well as decrease the temperature of the blood in order to freeze
            targets.</p>

        <ul class="text-left mx-5 mb-5">
            <li>
                <b id="ability-text" class="text-left mb-5">Blade Form One: Helspada</b>
                <p id="ability-text">As a bonus action, you emit then solidify your blood into a crimson sword. The
                    sword functions the same as a longsword in terms of properties and does an extra Slashing damage
                    equal to a roll of your Hemorrhage Trigger dice. In addition, since the blade is made from your
                    blood, you can choose to dismiss it as a free action. Helspada is required to perform all other
                    techniques in the Cero branch other than Form One.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b id="ability-text" class="text-left mb-5">Blade Form Two: Crimson Knitting Strands</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p id="ability-text">Once per short or long rest, when you successfully hit a creature with
                            Helspada, you can then activate this ability. The blade is converted to a web of string that
                            ensnared the target. It must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be Restrained. It can
                            make the saving throw again at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on a
                            successful save.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p id="ability-text"><b>Dragontangle – Edolon</b>: as a bonus action, you can then freeze the blood threads restraining the creature. It must then succeed a Constitution saving throw or take 3d10 Cold damage on a failed save and half the damage on a successful one.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>
                <b id="ability-text" class="text-left mb-5">Blade Form Three: Heavenly Piercing Hellscape</b>
                <p id="ability-text">As an action, you stab Helspada down into the ground where you stand, splitting it into a series of blood threads and freeze them to form icicle spikes, impaling creatures in a 10 ft radius. A creature in the radius must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 8d6 Cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half damage. You can use this ability once per short or long rest.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <b id="ability-text" class="text-left mb-5">Blade Form Four: Bone-Freezing Cleaver</b>
                <p id="ability-text">As a bonus action, you change the shape and form of Helspada into that of a massive greatsword covered in frozen spikes. Helspada is now considered a greatsword that does extra Cold damage instead of Slashing damage.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b id="ability-text" class="text-left mb-5">Blade Form Five: Sky Soaring Needle</b>

                    <li>
                        <p id="ability-text">As a bonus action, you change the shape and form of Helspada into that of a long and thin needle with a thin line of blood connected at the end. This form of Helspada retains its longsword properties along with the extra damage as well as gaining the Thrown property with a range of 30/60 ft. In addition, thanks to the blood line connecting the “blade”, you can spend a bonus action to pull on it to return Helspada back to you.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p id="ability-text"><b>Piercing Fang – Icicle Crash</b>: once per short or long rest, as an action, you throw Helspada at a creature within range. On a successful hit, the target suffers the weapon damage then, icicles explode at the impact point, forcing it to succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 Cold damage. It takes half the damage on a successful save.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p id="ability-text"><b>Piercing Fang – Interconnnectedness</b>:     once per short of long rest, as an action, you throw Helspada at a creature within range. After a successful hit and the creature has suffered the weapon damage, you maneuver Helspada to aim and launch itself at a different creature within 10 ft the original target. Roll to hit again and the target of the leaping hit only suffers Cold damage equal to a roll of your Hemorrhage Trigger dice. The leaping effects end when Helspada has traveled to the max limit of 60 ft of the blood line attached to it, when the attack misses its target or when you choose to stop the effect.</p>

            When you successfully hits a target with your blood weapon, you can choose to perform this technique by expending the rest of your turn. You must speak aloud the target’s true name and force it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the blood weapon splits into a net made of blood and wraps around the target, sealing them in a small crimson blade permanently. On a successful save, the target is not sealed but the save DC is increased by 1 when the sealing is attempt again. This seal can only be broken by a Wish spell.
