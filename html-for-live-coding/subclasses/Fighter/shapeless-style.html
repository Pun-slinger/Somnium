        <p id="subclass-overview-text" class="text-left mx-5 mb-5 p-2 rounded">
            <i>The Shapeless sword style was developed as a direct counter to the Destruction martial arts style. As a
                swordsmen of the Shapeless style, you and your blade are one in the same and like water: free, flexible,
                formless and shapeless. The techniques involves the wielder pushing their body and weapon to their
                limits to match the fluid motions mimicking flowing water.</i>

                    extremely thin and soft like a whip but it can also be straightened to be use as a regular sword
                    depending on the wielder’s command.</p>
            </li>
            <li>

                    force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a fail, it is Grappled and you can move the
                    creature up to 10 ft. The creature must be of size Medium or smaller to be moved and while it is
                    grappled, it takes 1d4 Slashing damage at the start of its turn. A creature can make a Strength
