<p id="subclass-overview-text" class="text-left mx-5 mb-5 p-2 rounded"><i>To swear an Oath of The Void is swearing a
    commitment to serve the Undeath Queen. Bathe in the darkness of the Void, paladins who swear this oath will be
    shunned, chastised and feared by many. However, to be swayed by the ideals of those who can not see behind the veil
    is to be fragile, not what a messenger of the Queen is supposed to represent. You take this oath because you love
    and care for the world and its people and you are not afraid to fight evil corruption with your own darkness.</i>
