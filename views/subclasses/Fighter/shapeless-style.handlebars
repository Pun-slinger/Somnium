<p id="subclass-overview-text" class="text-left mx-5 mb-5 p-2 rounded">
    <i>The Shapeless sword style was developed as a direct counter to the Destruction martial arts style. As a
        swordsmen of the Shapeless style, you and your blade are one in the same and like water: free, flexible,
        formless and shapeless. The techniques involves the wielder pushing their body and weapon to their
        limits to match the fluid motions mimicking flowing water.</i>
