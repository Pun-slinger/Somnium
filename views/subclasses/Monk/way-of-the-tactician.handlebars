<p id="ability-text" class="text-left mx-5 mb-2"><b>Observe</b>: As a bonus action, you can spend 1 Ki point to observe
    a creature and grant yourself or an ally within 30 ft of you that can see and hear you advantage on the next skill
    check for one of the following:</p>
<ul class="text-left mx-5">

<p id="ability-text" class="text-left mx-5 mb-5"><b>Combat Roll</b>:As a reaction to an ally within 15 ft of you that

    opportunity against an ally benefitting from this feature are made with disadvantage.</p>
